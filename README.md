A quick weaponization of "Your Social Media Fingerprint' by RobinLinus for reconnaissance.

After doing some research for a presentation on modern Phishing tactics, I came across Social Media Leak by Robin Linus (https://robinlinus.github.io/socialmedia-leak/) and decided to use some of his example code to produce a simple NodeJS / JS payload for recon work.

This work is mostly adapted from his, with some small (and very compatible XMLHTTPrequests being used to forward the client-side data to a backend NodeJS server for logging / monitoring.
